This is a simple appliacation that uses the awesome Rijkmuseusm API to fetch artwoks phots from the museum collection and display them based on the search keyords. 
I made a range input bar for selecting the number of photos shown in case it's necessary to save data or loading time.
For read semplicity all the code it's on the same page and I used vanilla JavaScript except for sending AJAX XMLHttpRequest that i used JQuery to simplify.

The collection counts 732538 artworks so I suggest you to try the most differtent keywords and have fun!
